## Issue body (verbatim)

## Bug

When a user uses Ctrl-C during `click.prompt()`, this may cause an unhandled exception. Seen during CI on an Ubuntu 22.04 arm github runner. The same test on Ubuntu 22.04 x64, macOS arm, Windows x64/arm succeeded. This is likely to be a race that doesn't pop up every time

```

## Replication

Probably a `click.prompt()` with Ctrl-C on a slower machine, run often enough to eventually trigger this race condition. In our case it was the free github `ubuntu-22.04-arm` runner.

## Expected

click handles the KeyboardInterrupt exception gracefully, regardless of timing or architecture.

Environment:

- Python version: 3.14
- Click version: 8.4.2

## Issue comments (verbatim)

@kdeldycke: This has been fixed upstream in the `stable` branch and will be part of Click 8.5.1. Can you confirm it fix your issue?

@yorickdowne: @kdeldycke Thank you! I can confirm that fixes it. A second interrupt no longer crashes click. In my testing, a single interrupt gives me "Aborted!", but two interrupts don't. I get a clean exit, but no message.
